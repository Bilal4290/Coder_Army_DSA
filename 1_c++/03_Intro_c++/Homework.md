🗺️ Day 3/180 => Introduction to c++ :

    🟢 Print number:

        ✅ Two numbers are given, print their product
        ✅ Two numbers are given a and b, print a-b
        ✅ Print 6*3 in output, don’t print 18, just 6*3 should be in the output screen.
        ✅ If we have only 4 bits, How 3 and -6 will be written in 4 bits.
        ✅ If we have only 5 bits, How 13 and -16 will be written in 5 bits.


✅ Representation of 3 and -6 in 4 Bits:

    🖥️ Represent 3 in 4-bit Binary:

        Since 3 is positive, we can directly convert it into binary using 4 bits:

            3 = 0011
        
        So, 3 in 4-bit binary → 0011

    🖥️ Represent -6 in 4-bit Binary:

        6 in 4 bit memory:

            6 = 0110

        Find Two’s Complement to Get -6:

            🔵 Invert the bits (One’s Complement):

                   0110 → 1001

            🔵  Add 1 to get Two’s Complement:

                    1001+1 = 1010

        So, -6 in 4-bit binary (Two’s Complement) → 1010
    



✅ Representation of 13 and -16 in 5 Bits:

    🖥️ Represent 13 in 4-bit Binary:

        Since 13 is positive, we can directly convert it into binary using 4 bits:

            13 = 01101
        
        So, 13 in 4-bit binary → 01101

    🖥️ Represent -16 in 5-bit Binary:

        -16 in 5 bit memory:

            16 = 10000

        Find Two’s Complement to Get -16:

            🔵 Invert the bits (One’s Complement):

                   10000 → 01111

            🔵  Add 1 to get Two’s Complement:

                    01111+1 = 

        So, -16 in 5-bit binary (Two’s Complement) → 10000
