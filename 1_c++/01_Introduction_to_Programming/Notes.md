👣 Early Humans and Counting:

    The first humans only ate, slept, and hunted. 🍖😴
    They had animals like goats and horses 🐐🐎 and needed a way to count them.
    But there was no number system back then! ❌🔢
    So, they used stones for counting:

        1 animal = 1 stone in the pocket 🪨
        More animals = More stones (but pockets got full! 😵)
        This led to the need for a number system.

🔢 The Decimal Number System (Base 10):

    Who invented it?

        ✅ Indians developed the decimal number system 🏆

    The decimal system has 10 digits: 0️⃣ 1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣ 4️⃣ 5️⃣ 6️⃣ 7️⃣ 8️⃣ 9️⃣
    Why 10 digits? Because humans have 10 fingers 🖐️🖐️!
    This made counting and arithmetic easier ➕➖✖️➗

📜 The Egyptian Number System:

    Egyptians used Base 60 🤯

        This is why we have 60 seconds in a minute and 360 degrees in a circle! ⏳⭕

    💰 Trade, Registers, and the Need for a Computer

        As people traded (import/export), they wrote transactions in registers 📖
        But what if there were 500 pages? 📚
        Calculating profits/losses manually was slow and error-prone 😓
        So, a device was needed that could calculate fast and accurately ➡️ Computer 💻

🖥️ Evolution of Computers:

    First computers were huge, accurate, but slow 🏢🐢
    Then, transistors were invented, making computers faster ⚡

    Transistors introduced the Binary Number System (Base 2)
        0 = Off (💡 OFF)
        1 = On (💡 ON)

    ⚡ The Binary Number System (Base 2)
    Binary has only two digits: 0 & 1

How to convert 27 to binary?

    Divide 27 by 2 (write quotient & remainder)
    Repeat until quotient = 0
    Reverse the remainders to get the binary number

    Example:
   
        27 ÷ 2 = 13 remainder 1  
        13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1  
        6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0  
        3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1  
        1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1  

    Binary of 27 = 11011 ✅

To convert binary to decimal?

    Use place value method (multiply each bit by powers of 2)


📊 Other Number Systems

    Octal (Base 8): Uses digits 0-7 🏆
    Hexadecimal (Base 16): Uses 0-9 & A-F
        10 = A
        11 = B
        12 = C
        13 = D
        14 = E
        15 = F

⚙️ How Do Transistors Work?

    Transistors = Tiny switches that control electric signals
    Work on binary (0 & 1) like a bulb ON/OFF 💡

📈 Moore's Law

    "Every 2 years, transistors in a chip double"
    Why? Because technology improves & we make smaller transistors
    More transistors = More speed 🚀

🖥️ Machine Language, Compilers & Interpreters

    Computers only understand 0 & 1 (Machine Language) 🤖
    We write in our language (Python, Java, etc.) 📝
    A Translator is needed to convert it:
        Compiler (translates everything at once) 🏃‍♂️
        Interpreter (translates line by line) 🚶‍♂️

🚀 High-Level vs Low-Level Languages

    Machine Language (0 & 1) → Fastest ⚡
    Assembly Language → Easier than Machine Language 🛠️
    High-Level Languages (Python, Java, C++) → Easy to write, but slower 📝

🌐 Internet & Data Storage

    Earlier, we stored data in pen drives 💾
    Now, we store data in databases & cloud ☁️
    We want less storage space & faster retrieval

📚 Why Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)?

    If data is properly arranged, searching is faster! 🔍
    Efficient algorithms save time & space ⏳
    Example:

        Unsorted data: Takes longer to find something
        Sorted data: Can find in seconds!

🎯 Summary

    Humans started counting with stones 🪨
    Decimal system (Base 10) invented by Indians 🇮🇳
    Egyptians used Base 60 ⏳
    Computers were invented to solve complex calculations 💻
    Binary system (0 & 1) came with transistors 🔢
    Moore’s Law → Transistors double every 2 years 🚀
    Machine Language → Assembly → High-Level Languages 🔄
    Data storage moved from pen drives to cloud & databases ☁️
    DSA is needed for fast data retrieval & efficient programs 📚
