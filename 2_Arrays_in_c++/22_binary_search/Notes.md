# 🧠 Binary Search:

📚 Real-Life Analogy: Finding a Word in a Dictionary
Imagine this:
You're looking for the word “Lemonade” in a dictionary.

Do you start from page 1? NO!
You flip open somewhere near the middle.

- If you land on "Mango", you know "Lemonade" is before it.

- If you land on "Kite", you know "Lemonade" is after it.
You then keep halving the search space and repeat this.

That’s Binary Search in real life!

## 🧪 Rule #1: The array must be sorted

Just like how a dictionary is in alphabetical order — Binary Search only works on sorted data.

---

## 🖥️ Code 
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Binary Search Function
int binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int start = 0;
    int end = size - 1;

    // Loop continues as long as start is less than or equal to end
    while (start <= end) {
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2; // Safe way to find middle (avoids overflow)

        // 🎯 Found the target
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        }
        // 🔍 Look to the right (bigger values)
        else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            start = mid + 1;
        }
        // 🔍 Look to the left (smaller values)
        else {
            end = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    // 😞 Target not found
    return -1;
}


int main() {
    int data[] = {2, 4, 6, 10, 15, 20, 25};  // Sorted array

    int size = sizeof(data) / sizeof(data[0]);

    int target = 15;

    int result = binarySearch(data, size, target);

    if (result != -1) {
        cout << "Element found at index: " << result << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Element not found." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

```

## 🧠 Visual Memory Trick:

Imagine a see-saw:

- Middle is the pivot.

- If your target is heavier (bigger), it’ll go right.

- If it’s lighter (smaller), it’ll tilt left.

Keep shifting your pivot based on where the weight is!

---


## 🔁 Loop Break Condition:
❓ When do we stop looking?

- When start > end.

🎯 Meaning: We've looked everywhere we could, and it's not there.

---

## 🧠 SUPER MEMORY AID:

"Binary Search is like guessing a number between 1 to 100."
- If your guess is too low → guess higher.

- If your guess is too high → guess lower.

- Keep cutting the range in half each time.

That’s what Binary Search does.

---

## 🚀 Summary of Steps (Think like a robot detective):

1. Make sure array is sorted

2. Find the middle

3. Compare:

    -     == → Found it 🎉

    -     < → Go right 👉

   -     >  → Go left 👈
  

Repeat until start > end

## ⏱️ Time Complexity of Binary Search

Let's break it down:
You're halving the array each time:

- Start with N elements

- After 1 step → N / 2

- After 2 steps → N / 4

- After 3 steps → N / 8

- ...

- After k steps → N / 2^k = 1

Solve for k :

𝑁 = 2<sup>k</sup>  ⇒ log<sub>2</sub>𝑁 = 𝑘

So, number of steps = k + 1 ≈ O(log₂N)

💡 Big-O ignores constants, so +1 and log 2 are dropped.

---

## ✅ Final Time Complexities:

| Case     | Complexity  | Meaning                                                   |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Best** | Ω(1)        | Found target in first try (middle element is the target!) |
| **Worst**| Θ(log₂N)    | Need to keep halving until only 1 element left            |
| **Average** | O(log₂N) | Typically logarithmic steps required                      |

## 💾 Space Complexity of Binary Search

You're just using a few variables : start, end, mid

✅ Space Complexity = O(1) (constant space)

---

## ❌ The Problem : Integer Overflow

If you use:

## Code :

```
int mid = (start + end) / 2;
```

It can overflow when start and end are both large integers (close to INT_MAX).

---

## ✅ The Fix: Safe Mid Calculation

```
int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
```

## 🔍 Why it works:

- end - start avoids overflow (it's a smaller difference)

- Then you divide by 2 and safely add it to start
